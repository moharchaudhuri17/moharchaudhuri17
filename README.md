<h2 align="center">Hello World! üëã</h2>

---
I'm Mohar Chaudhuri!

Impact Evaluation Consultant at the World Bank, combining rigorous statistical analysis with development economics to drive evidence-based policy decisions. Graduate of Toulouse School of Economics (M.S. Statistics and Econometrics) and Jadavpur University (B.A. Economics), specializing in econometrics and causal inference.
I leverage advanced quantitative methods to evaluate development programs and translate complex data into actionable insights. My work spans multivariate regression analysis, time-series modeling, and experimental design, helping stakeholders understand what works in development interventions and why.
When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen, applying the same precision and creativity to culinary adventures as I do to statistical analysis.
Open to connecting with fellow development practitioners, economists, and data enthusiasts.
