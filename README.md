Currently completing my MS in Business Analytics at UT Austin McCombs (Financial Analytics track), where I combine rigorous statistical methods with hands-on implementation—from NLP-powered recommendation systems to portfolio optimization with advanced risk modeling.

When I'm not training models, I'm experimenting in the kitchen with the same precision I bring to my code.
Open to data science opportunities across finance, tech, and analytics. Let's connect!
